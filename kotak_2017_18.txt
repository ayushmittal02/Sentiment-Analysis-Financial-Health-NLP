Banks are going through turbulent times. The shock
of recent losses incurred by banks looks unreal.
This reality looks like it is a culmination of years of
kicking the can. Are these heightened provisions a
short-term phenomenon for the next few quarters?
It seems so as of now. The silver lining amidst this
chaos is the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)
which is a game changer. It has changed the game
from debtor in possession to creditor in possession
in case of defaults. However, in Indian Banking,
history repeats itself. How do we prevent this from
happening again?
This is the most understated
but crucial banking function.
Underwriting is key. Errors of
‘Commission’ not ‘Omission’
destroy banks. Another
underestimated risk is operational
risk. Gaps in operational risk
management were highlighted in
the recent Letter of Undertaking
(LoU) scandal. We also
underestimate the importance of
reputational risk management. This is the heart of the issue.
It includes governance by the
state, the regulators, and of course,
by the banks. As reflected by events
around us, it is naïve for policy
makers to believe that diversified
ownership/state ownership is the
way to good governance in
banking. Banks deal with other
people’s money. The issue is
directors and managers with
no skin in the game are taking decisions on lending and writing off
thousands of crores!
Sound principles of corporate
governance and harmonious
functioning between government
and regulators are the crucial
elements for a sound future
of banking.
Conduct
In this era of short termism, bankers
are driven by targets, incentives and
ESOPs. Trade-off between customer
centricity and achieving targets
leads to perverse behaviour. The
recent case of a leading US bank is
an example. Similarly, taking higher
risks for short-term boost to profits
is a recipe for disaster.
As I have mentioned earlier, bankers
need three human qualities –
Prudence, Simplicity and Humility.
Conduct is the key to our future.
Letter versus Spirit
The time has come for us to be
driven by spirit and not letter.
When in doubt, let us follow spirit
as our driving compass.
The points which I have
mentioned above lie at
the heart of restoring
and sustaining trust in
Indian banking.
Report Card
International factors – hardening
oil prices and the expected
increase in US Fed rates later
this year, are putting pressure
on our macro economy. India’s
current account and fiscal deficit
will both face challenges. At the
same time, our micro economy
is doing better. Over the last four
years, we saw a good macro and a
tough micro. In 2018, we are likely
to see a tough macro and a
better micro.
Your bank’s (consolidated)
performance for FY 2017-18 reflects
that reality. The formalisation
of the Indian economy in the
financial sector will continue to
gain momentum. In this context,
our fundamental business model
of concentrated India, diversified
financial services is likely to deliver
positive results for our businesses.
I am happy to share that all our
business metrics – loan growth,
quality of our loan book and the
overall parameters in our core
banking business, insurance,
wealth management, securities,
asset management, and the overall
financial services franchise are
well positioned.
On 29 th March, 2017, while
launching 811, we had made
a commitment to double our
customer base in 18 months, that
is, to about 16 million by September
2018. I am happy to share that we
are on course to achieve the
target. As of 31 st March, 2018,
we have crossed the 13 million mark (which includes our 811
customers as well).
The Life Insurance business, until last
year, was a joint venture between
Old Mutual and Kotak Mahindra
Bank with the ownership ratio of
26:74, between the two entities.
We bought Old Mutual’s stake in
October 2017, and now Kotak Life
Insurance is a 100% subsidiary of
the Bank. We are happy to
report that our Indian Embedded
Value number stands at `5,824
crore and our Value of New
Business (VNB) margin is 29% as on
31 st March, 2018.
Another important area where we
are making an important disclosure
is in our Wealth Management
business and our Priority Banking
business. The relationship value
number is in excess of `2,25,000
crore. We believe we are the market
leader in this segment, and will
continue to strive and strengthen
our positioning.
Last but not the least, Kotak
Securities commands 8.5% market
share in the cash segment and our
Group Assets Under Management
(AUM) has grown by 29%.
Post FY 2016-17, I see three mega
trends emerging in the Indian
financial services space. The first
mega trend is stressed asset woes
and capital crunch that will lead to subdued growth in public sector
banks. Over the next five years,
private sector banks will increase
their industry share from 30% to
50%. The second mega trend is the
formalisation of savings, which
we are already witnessing.
The third is digital. Digital combined
with Aadhaar is a massive game
changer. I cannot over emphasise
Aadhaar.
India needs to grow at 9% per
annum sustainably for the next
20 years to reach China’s current
per capita income. To achieve
this, the wheels of finance must
move seamlessly and speedily. We
at Kotak are committed to be an
integral part of India’s mission.
We see an opportunity for us to
sustainably grow in the financial
services space at over 2X India’s
nominal GDP growth.
We are committed to customer
interests, high quality governance,
risk management and conduct as
the bedrock of this aspiration.
